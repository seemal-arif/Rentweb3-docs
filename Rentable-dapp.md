### Rentable Dapps

Dapps are the `Decentralized Applications` or `Blockchain based websites` in simple terms.
Dapps are expensive to build both in the  sense of money and time. A Complete dapp involve stuff like 

  - Front end development
  - Wallets integration
  - Smart contracts Interaction

what if we can build dapp once and earn lifetime ?
what if you don not have to pay the entire price if you want to use it for just a little time ?

Well , here we got you covered.

RentWeb3 introduces a new paradigm of dapps that is dapp renting.

#### What is a Rentable Dapp ?

You build your dapp in a way that it is compatible with almost any dynamic data of specific use-case.
Not clear right ? Do not worry ! Let's learn this paradigm by an example

##### Example
  
  Say you have made an app located at address https://Nifter.vercel.app which takes a smart contract address of NFT collection ( ERC721 right now) .
  It has the ability to show the collection stored by the smart contract and then the website can perform
  the sale or whitelisting of it. With some minor tweaks , the developer can make his\her dapp really dynamic .
  
  Developer can follow some strategies to design such dapp in a way that NFT collection shown on the screen
  is read from smart contract that has been past to it ( we will discuss shortly ).
  Similarly , the dapp should be able to receive a contract address and then each time,
  when a user wants to mint a specific token of that collection , the dapp performs purchasing 
  of the NFT from the passed contract.
  
  The smart contract address is not passed to dapp as there is no such way but
  we introduce another way in [here](https://github.com/rentweb3/Rentweb3-docs/blob/main/Making-rentable-dapp.md).
